# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
from its first published release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Authenticated password changes require the current credential and atomically
  replace its hash, revoke renewable sessions, invalidate previously issued
  access tokens, and write a credential-free audit record.
- Administrative account provisioning can issue an expiring temporary
  credential, and administrative resets rotate credential state while revoking
  existing sessions and requiring the account holder to choose a permanent password.

### Security

- JWT validation now checks a server-side credential version, and password
  changes have a dedicated per-user rate limit and PostgreSQL concurrency lock.
- Temporary credentials are generated with operating-system cryptographic
  randomness, consumed atomically on first login, stored only as password hashes,
  returned with no-store headers, and restricted from business operations until
  their mandatory replacement.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Integrated vehicle-access MVP for general entries, open records, exits,
  audited descriptive corrections, history, recurring vehicle-and-driver lookup,
  institutional fleet and drivers, vehicle usages, event authorizations, daily
  summaries, user accounts, and audit-trail consultation.
- Individual authentication with short-lived access tokens, server-controlled
  renewable sessions, protected cookies, CSRF validation, rotation, revocation,
  logout, account lockout, and progressive password-hash upgrades.
- Responsive React interface with profile-aware navigation, accessible feedback,
  keyboard flows, mobile layouts, and automated accessibility checks.
- Operational shortcuts for reusing canonical recurring vehicle and driver data
  and filtering open accesses by the categories present in the current result.
- Structured Issue forms for defects, improvements, and documentation.
- Pull Request checklist for traceability, validation, security, privacy, and operations.
- Project favicon based on the vehicle-access artwork.
- PostgreSQL persistence with versioned Entity Framework Core migrations,
  transactionally consistent auditing, constraints, and concurrency controls.
- Disposable PostgreSQL recovery and integrated Compose smoke-test workflows.
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for configurable OTLP export.
- Multi-platform `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` container validation and publication.
- Architecture-specific SPDX SBOMs attached to each published multi-platform manifest.
- Passive OWASP ZAP baseline reports for the disposable integrated stack.
- Semantic container tags associated with reviewed Git tags and GitHub Releases.

### Changed

- Authenticated navigation now uses a contained active state and the accessible
  drawer through tablet widths, preserving the fixed sidebar for wide screens.
- Container scanning now rejects every critical vulnerability, including findings
  without an available fix, while continuing to reject fixable high-severity findings.
- Backend and frontend runtime containers use non-root users, read-only root
  filesystems, dropped capabilities, and defensive HTTP headers.

### Fixed

- Warning-level GitHub Code Quality Reliability findings in backend queries and tests.
- Intermittent recurring-search tests by isolating mock state and controlling only
  the debounce clock in the affected scenarios.
- OCI attestation jobs can persist artifact storage metadata with job-scoped permission.

### Security

- GitHub Actions use job-scoped minimum permissions and third-party actions pinned
  to reviewed commit SHAs.
- Published manifests include signed provenance and architecture-specific SBOM
  attestations bound to their immutable digest.

This is a technical MVP release for demonstration and evaluation. It is not an
institutional production approval or deployment.

## Release process

Before publishing a release:

1. review the changes accumulated under `Unreleased` against merged Pull Requests;
2. move those entries to a new `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` section with the release date;
3. keep only user-facing, security, operational, and compatibility-relevant changes;
4. create the Git tag and GitHub Release from the reviewed commit on `main`;
5. open a new empty `Unreleased` section for subsequent work.

Changes merged before this changelog was introduced remain traceable through the
Git history, Pull Requests, Issues, and project Wiki. They must not be
retroactively presented as a published release without an evidence-based review.
